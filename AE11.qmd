### Making Plots Interactive

```{r interactive_plots}

  ggplot(aes(x = price, fill = garage)) +

  labs(
    x = "Price in $",

    title = "Histogram of Price of Homes by Garage or not",
    fill = "Garage or not"
  )
```


```{r interactive_plots_2}

### Part 1

Make the histogram interactive using 'ggigraph'.

```{r ggigraph}

df_hist_ggigraph<-
duke_forest |>
  mutate(garage = if_else(str_detect(parking, "Garage"), "Garage", "No garage")) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = price, fill = garage)) +
  
  geom_histogram_interactive(aes(tooltip = paste0("Number of Homes\n", after_stat(count)))) +
  facet_wrap(~garage, ncol = 1) +
  labs(
    x = "Price in $",
    y = "",
    title = "Histogram of Price of Homes by Garage or not",
    fill = "Garage or not"
  )

girafe(ggobj=df_hist_ggigraph)
df_hist_ggigraph

```



Make a scatterplot interactive using 'ggigraph'.

```{r ggigraph_scatterplot}


df_scatter_int <-
  
  ggplot(duke_forest, aes(x = price, y = year_built, color = year_built)) +
  
  geom_point_interactive(mapping = aes(tooltip = address ), size = 3) +
  geom_smooth(se= FALSE) +
  labs(
    x = "Area of House",
    y = "Price of House",
    title = "Relationship between Price and Area by Year Built",
    color = "Year Built"
  ) +theme_minimal()

girafe(ggobj = df_scatter_int)

df_scatter_int
```


Make a scatterplot interactive.

```{r scatterplot_interactive}


df_scatter_int <-
  
  ggplot(duke_forest, aes(x = price, y = year_built, color = year_built)) +
  
  geom_point_interactive(mapping = aes(tooltip = scales::dollar(price)), size = 3) +
  geom_smooth(se= FALSE) +
  labs(
    x = "Area of House",
    y = "Price of House",
    title = "Relationship between Price and Area by Year Built",
    color = "Year Built"
  ) +theme_minimal()

girafe(ggobj = df_scatter_int)

df_scatter_int
```
